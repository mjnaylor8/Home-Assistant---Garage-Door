# Home-Assistant---Garage-Door
Helper and Automations for Garage Door


This was inspired by https://www.speaktothegeek.co.uk/2023/06/esphome-smart-garage-door-controller/.

However I found the Home Assistant Cover did not do what I wanted and so decided to develop my own 'opener'.  The code will not be the best fully optimised code there is but it works for me!

Based on a D1 Mini ESP8266 Dev Board microcontroller a Relay Module 1Ch 5V with Optocoupler and a reed switch all purchased from https://www.bitsboxuk.com/.
I used ESP Home to programme the D1 Mini.
